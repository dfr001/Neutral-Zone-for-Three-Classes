# Neutral Zone Classification for Three Classes
R and python scripts to determine the asymmetric neutral zone developed in "[A neutral zone classifier for three classes with an application to text mining](https://doi.org/10.1002/sam.11639)." The R script is presented in the context of text classification. However, the classifier may be extracted and used in more general situations.

The python script defines the necessary functions and presents an example using simulated data and a multinomial logistic regression classifier.
